## INTERESTS

I enjoy tinkering with computers and computer programming. I am interested in learning new programming techniques and improving my skills. In my free time I play videogames and hang out with my friends, I often host game servers on an old PC which I have used to gain Linux experience. When programming I prefer to use WSL as many programming tools are better tailored to Linux environments. I commute by bicycle because itâ€™s environmentally friendly and it keeps me active.
